abstract: 'Semantic Parsing aims to capture the meaning of a sentence and convert it into a logical,
structured form. Previous studies show that
semantic parsing enhances the performance of
smaller models (e.g., BERT) on downstream
tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the
improvements extend similarly to LLMs. In
this paper, our empirical findings reveal that,
unlike smaller models, directly adding semantic parsing results into LLMs reduces their
performance. To overcome this, we propose
SENSE, a novel prompting approach that embeds semantic hints within the prompt. Experiments show that SENSE consistently improves
LLMs’ performance across various tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating semantic
information to improve LLM capabilities.'
